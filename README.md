# UIU

> A _yet-to-be-written_ React component library, with [**Bit**][2] at its foundation.

**UIU** was initiated as a [Create React App][3], but its main purpose is to serve as a repository for components, utilities and helpers to be developed, tested and maintained alongside each other - while publishing them separately.

All elements under UIU's [collection at **Bit**][4] are used by me quite often. With **Bit** I can finally maintain them from one repository (this one). 🙂

Each element (components, utilities, helpers, styles, etc) lives in its own isolated scope, whilst being available to any other application through **Bit**'s own registry scope. I warmly encourage everyone to look up on [**Bit**][2]'s features, which are many.

This is a work in progress, so documentation will be written as the project evolves. The project is just some sort of placeholder at its current stage.
