# UIU

> 🚧⚡🧪 A _yet-to-be-written_ development library, with [**Bit**][2] at its foundation.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dreamyguy/uiu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dreamyguy/uiu) [![Node Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v12.14.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v12.14.0) [![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/uiu/blob/master/LICENSE)

**UIU** was initialized as a [Create React App][3], but its main purpose is to serve as a repository for components, utilities and helpers to be developed, tested and maintained alongside each other - while publishing them separately.

All elements under [UIU's collection at **Bit**][4] are used by me quite often. With **Bit** I can finally maintain them from one repository (this one). 🙂

Each element (be it a component, utility, helper, styling, etc) lives in its own isolated scope, whilst being available to any other application through **Bit**'s own registry scope. I warmly encourage everyone to look up on [**Bit**][2]'s features, which are many.

Every **Bit** element is self-documented, with preview, at [**Bit**][4]'s end.

This is a work in progress, so documentation will be written as the project evolves. The project is just some sort of placeholder at its current stage.
